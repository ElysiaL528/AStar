# AStar

A pathfinding algorithm that implements various heuristic methods, namely Manhattan, Diagonal, and Euclidian. Depending on the chosen heuristic, which is passed into the constructor of the graph, the algorithm estimates the distance of the end point from the current point and generates the fastest path.
The visualizer consists of a grid of letters with the calculated path colored red.
